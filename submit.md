The Metagov Journal invites submissions along two tracks: 
1. **Living institutions** including online communities, companies, movements, in-use contracts, and other institutional forms. We **do not** publish conceptual designs and proposals.
2. Everything else, including traditional research papers, review papers, and non-peer-reviewed editorial content.

All submissions should be made [via OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=metagov.org/Metagov). All submissions must contain an abstract and a citation list. The format for new living institutions should roughly follow [this template](https://github.com/metagov/journal/blob/main/_posts/2025-08-09-metagov-journal.md).

Note that acceptance of publication is contingent on the authors posting an archival copy on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org), [SSRN](https://www.ssrn.com), or [GitHub](https://github.com/metagov/journal/_posts/).
