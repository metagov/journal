The **Metagov Journal** publishes living institutions, including  online communities, companies, movements, contracts, and other institutional forms. We also publish a range of traditional papers and op-eds related to these institutions. We are a diamond open-access (free to submit, free to read) overlay journal (we host archival copies on arXiv, SSRN, and GitHub) with an open peer review system (reviews for accepted publications are public).
